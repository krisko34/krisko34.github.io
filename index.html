            <h1>Drifting</h1>
            <p>
              Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tires,
              while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner.
              Car drifting is caused when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle, to such
              an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left,
              wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).
              As a motoring discipline, drifting competitions were first popularized in 1970s Japan, and today are held
              worldwide and are judged according to the speed, angle, showmanship and line taken through a corner or set of corners.[1]
              The desired line is usually dictated by the judge or judges,
              who describe their desired line as well as highlight areas of importance, such as clipping zones, clipping points and touch and go areas.
              <br>
              <h2>Origin</h2><br>
            Japan was the birthplace of drifting.[2][3][4] It was most popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races.
            The famous motorcyclist turned driver, Kunimitsu Takahashi, was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s.
            This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The bias ply racing tires of the
            1960sâ€“1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did the street racers.[5]
